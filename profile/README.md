# Quality and Clean Code in Software Development
<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

## Introduction

The next projects are made to understand better the importance of different principles to create a quality and clean code.

Clean and quality code is the backbone of any successful software project. Here are a few key reasons why having clean and quality is essential:

1. **Readibility:** Clean code is easy to read and understand, making it accessible to both the original developer and anyone who might work on the code in the future. This readability reduces the time and effort required for maintenance and troubleshooting.

2. **Maintainability:** Well-structured and organized code is easier to maintain and update. When the codebase is clean, making changes, fixing bugs, and adding new features becomes a smoother process, saving time and reducing the risk of introducing new issues.

3. **Collaboration:**  In a collaborative environment, clean code is like a common language that everyone can understand. It fosters effective teamwork by making it simpler for team members to work together, review each other's code, and provide constructive feedback.

4. **Performance:** Quality code is often more efficient and consumes fewer system resources. This results in faster and more responsive software, which can have a significant impact on user experience and satisfaction.

5. **Debugging:** Clean code reduces the likelihood of bugs and makes it easier to identify and resolve issues when they do occur. This helps in minimizing downtime and delivering a more reliable product.

6. **Scalability:** A well-organized codebase is more adaptable to future changes and growth. It's easier to scale and expand the software without introducing complications or bottlenecks.

7. **Cost-Efficiency:** Clean code reduces long-term development costs. While it may require more effort and discipline upfront, it pays off by lowering the total cost of ownership over the software's lifecycle.

8. **Documentation:** Clean code often serves as its own documentation. When code is self-explanatory, it reduces the need for extensive external documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the code.

In summary, clean and quality code is the foundation for a successful software project. It ensures that the software is reliable, maintainable, efficient, and adaptable, while also fostering collaboration and reducing the total cost of ownership. It's an investment that pays off in the long run, leading to better outcomes and a more positive experience for both developers and end-users.

## How to use use and run the projects

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Click on *File -> Open Project*. Select the whole file of the project you want to use:
   ![image](https://github.com/Rosol-Repository/.github/assets/150232709/7cac91be-11c9-4e83-9b90-9984984fdb07) 

4. Click OK
5. Navigate to the **Main.java** of the project, in this example: *DRY\src\main\java\org.example\Main* and click on the run button:
   ![image-1](https://github.com/Rosol-Repository/.github/assets/150232709/0e29cdd9-a676-43bb-9aa2-ea025421be0c) 

The comments explain the different functionalities and there is also presentations to explain the theory and the project.

## Principles
The different principles used and explained in the projects  are: *Abstraction, DRY, Encapsulation, Inheritance, KISS, Lambda Expressions, Marshalling, Model-View-Controller, Overloading, Polymorphism and SOLID (Dependency Inversion, Interface Segregation, Liskov Substitution, Open Close and Single Responsability)*
